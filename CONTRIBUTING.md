# Contributing

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute. All contributions are more than welcome!

## How can I contribute?

If you have an awesome new feature that you want to implement or you found a bug that you would like to fix, here are some instructions to guide you through the process:

- **Create an issue** to explain and discuss the details
- **Fork the repo**
- **Clone the repo** and set it up
- **Implement** the necessary changes
- **Create tests** to keep the code coverage high
- **Send a pull request**

## Guidelines

### Git commit messages

- Limit the subject line to 72 characters
- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Reference issues and pull requests in the body
